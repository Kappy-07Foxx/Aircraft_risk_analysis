Aviation Risk Analysis Dashboard
📄 Presentation
[View Business Presentation (PDF)](Presentation.pdf)



This project explores and visualizes aviation incident data to uncover patterns and assess risks associated with different aircraft categories, purposes of flight, weather conditions, and flight phases.



\##  Objectives

\- Clean and prepare aviation incident data using Python (Pandas).

\- Analyze patterns in fatal injuries, total people involved, and risk factors.

\- Build an interactive Tableau dashboard to explore the data visually.



\##  Tools Used

\- Python (Pandas, Jupyter Notebook)

\- Tableau Public

\- Git \& GitHub



\## 📁 Files Included

\- `aircraft\_cleaned\_data.csv` – Cleaned dataset used for Tableau

\- `Sylvia\_project.ipynb` – Notebook for data cleaning and EDA

\- Sylvia\_project in PDF format

\## 📌 Key Visualizations

1\. Fatal Injuries by Aircraft Category

2\. Purpose of Flight vs Fatalities

3\. Weather Conditions \& Incident Severity

4\. Flight Phase Analysis

5\. Total People Involved per Year



\## 💡 Insights \& Recommendations

INSIGHTS

* Airplanes account for the highest number of fatalities, but also represent the largest proportion of aircraft in operation. Helicopters are second in both frequency and fatality count. Small categories like Gliders, Balloons, and Powered Parachutes show lower fatalities, but may be less scalable for commercial use.
* some aircraft categories like "Powered-Lift", "Blimp", or "Rocket" don’t even have injury data because:
* They're rarely used, especially in commercial settings.
* Accidents involving them are extremely uncommon or underreported.
* Some might be military-only or experimental, hence not logged in public dataset



Recommendations



-Based on analysis of aircraft incident data, the categories such as Powered Parachute, Weight-Shift, and Glider consistently show the lowest mean fatal injuries, making them ideal for low-risk entry into the aviation industry. 

-In contrast, Airplanes and Helicopters, while common, have significantly higher injury rates, suggesting the need for more stringent safety measures and risk assessments before investment
